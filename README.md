# Yelp-Business-Performance-and-Customer-Satisfaction-Analysis

### Problem Statement:
Yelp hosts about 7 million reviews across roughly 150,000 businesses in our dataset.Business owners care why some listings attract more reviews and stronger ratings than others.
Our goal is to understand how business profiles and customer feedback relate to performance on Yelp. We aim to help business owners utilize Yelp reviews and understand the key drivers of a business, and how customer reviews can be leveraged to transform existing business.

### Key Insights:

1. Yelp data shows strong geographic and category concentration: a few regions and experience-driven categories generate most activity.


2. Some categories and cities, achieve both high and very stable ratings, while service-heavy sectors suffer extremely high negative-review shares.


3. Negative reviews, low categories ranking, and detailed critical feedback draw the most engagement, so they shape how customers choose businesses.


4. Listing hours and completing profiles are low-effort actions that are associated with higher ratings, more reviews, and stronger overall engagement on Yelp.
